# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection (React + Vite)

A web application built using **React** and **Vite** that helps users identify plant diseases by uploading an image of a plant.
This is the **initial phase** of the project — basic setup and structure are ready, and future updates will include full functionality.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The goal of this project is to create a **plant disease identification system**.
Users will be able to:

* Upload an image of a plant
* Get details about the plant
* Identify possible diseases and see recommendations

This front-end React app will later connect to a **Python-based backend** that performs image analysis using a trained machine learning model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumo-07/PlantDisease_React.git
cd PlantDisease_React
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app in development mode using **Vite**.

### 4. Build for Production

## 📋 Current Progress

* ✅ React + Vite setup complete
* ✅ Project structure created
* 🕓 Working on UI components (image upload, display area, etc.)
* 🔜 Next step: connect with a backend API for plant disease detection

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap

**Short Term:**

* Build the UI for image upload and result display
* Connect to backend (Flask/FastAPI)
* Display disease name and suggestions

**Mid Term:**

* Add user authentication
* Save user history and results
* Improve design and responsiveness

---

## 🌱 Future Vision

The ultimate goal is to create a smart plant disease detection system that combines:

* Web technology (React)
* Machine learning (Python)
* IoT devices (camera or sensors)

Making plant health monitoring **accessible, accurate, and automatic** 🌿
