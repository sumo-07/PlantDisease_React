PlantDisease_React

A front-end React + Vite application for plant disease identification (initial phase)

🚀 Project Overview

This project is the front-end portion of a plant disease identification system where users can upload a plant image and receive detailed information about the plant and any diseases detected.
Since you are a beginner in IoT and working with Python & building technical skills (JavaScript, React, Git etc.), this repo uses modern front-end tooling and sets the stage for integration with a back-end (e.g., for model inference).

🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

React – The UI library used for building the interface.

Vite – The build tool / dev server for faster hot module replacement and lightweight config.

ESLint – Included for linting and code quality.

JavaScript (ES6+) – The main language.

CSS – Styling via standard CSS (you may later add frameworks or styled-components).

Folder structure:

src/ – Source code for components, assets, etc.

public/ – Static assets and index.html.

package.json / vite.config.js – Configuration of dependencies & build.

✅ Current Status

Project scaffolded with Vite + React, minimal structure in place.

Basic layout ready (index.html, React root, etc).

No full feature implementation yet (uploading images, API integration, model inference, etc) – this is an initial phase.

ToDo: integration of machine learning back-end, plant disease model, handling image upload, result display, user feedback.

🎯 Goals & Roadmap
Short-Term

Create UI for: image upload, preview, submission button.

Integrate with a simple back-end API endpoint for disease detection (could be a Python Flask/FastAPI server).

Display results: plant species, disease type, severity, recommendations.

Mid-Term

Add authentication (user login/signup) if needed.

Persist results/history for users.

Improve UI/UX: responsive design, better styling, error handling.

Add more plant species & disease dataset.

Long-Term

Possibly move into IoT territory: mobile device capture, live camera feed, offline model inference (if you dive into Python + ML).

Deploy full-stack app: front-end (this React app) + back-end service + database + hosting.

Add analytics, user feedback loop, continuous model improvement.

📝 How to Get Started

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/sumo-07/PlantDisease_React.git
cd PlantDisease_React


Install dependencies

npm install


or

yarn


Start development server

npm run dev


This runs the app in dev mode with hot module replacement (thanks to Vite).

Build for production

npm run build


This generates optimized build output for deployment.

Serve production build

npm run preview


(Provided by Vite to preview the built app locally.)
